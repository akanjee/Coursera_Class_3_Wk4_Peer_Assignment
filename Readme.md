Coursera_Class_3_Wk4_Peer_Assignment

This GitHub Repo is for my Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project files.

There are 4 files in this directory:

C3_WK4_A1_CodeBook.Rmd --> A R Markdown file that provides a description of what the run_analysis.r file is doing
README.md --> This markdown file
run_analysis.R --> A R-Script to download the FITBIT data from the web, import, clean, transform, aggregate and output the information to tidydata.txt
tidydata.txt --> The cleaned and transformed output from my run_analysis.r
